# Debian and its derivatives, running the native client

Oh, so you chose the hard way. Good luck! Given it's 2025, we assume you are using the 64bit client

## Download and execute the installer

1. [Download the game](https://www.championsofregnum.com/index.php?l=1&sec=6)
2. Make the installer executable:
   - either through a right click on your installation file, then (usually) properties, then setting it executable for the user
   - or easier, in a terminal: `chmod 0700 ~/Downloads/ROInstall_64`
3. Execute the installer:
   - just (double) click on it
   - you can also run it from the terminal: `~/Downloads/ROInstall_64`
  
## Installing the necessary links and packages

Install the `cor-debian-packages` meta package at [https://github.com/mascaldotfr/cor-debian-packages](https://github.com/mascaldotfr/cor-debian-packages) (you'll find instructions there as well)

## Have fun

You may get further issues after running the game, see [the troubleshooting section](troubleshooting.md) if it occurs.
